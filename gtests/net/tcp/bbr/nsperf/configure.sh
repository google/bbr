# On Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS, there are issues with the iproute2 binaries:
#  (1) the 'tc' binary  has a bug and cannot parse netem random loss rates
#  (2) the 'ss' tool is missing recent socket stats
# In addition, all off-the-shelf iproute2 binaries lack support for features
# added in BBRv3.
# So to use this testing tool we build our own iproute2 tools
# from the iproute2 sources, with patches from the BBRv3
# source tree:

sudo apt install -y pkg-config make bison flex

# Our project's patches for the iproute2 package are in this directory:
PATCH_DIR=`pwd`
