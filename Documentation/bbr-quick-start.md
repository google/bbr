# TCP BBR Quick-Start: Building and Running TCP BBR on Google Compute Engine

Google recently contributed BBR ("Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT"), a new
congestion control algorithm, to the the Linux kernel TCP stack. The commit
description in the
[Linux TCP BBR commit](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git/commit/?id=0f8782ea14974ce992618b55f0c041ef43ed0b78)
describes the background, motivation, design, and example performance results
for BBR.

This tutorial shows how to download, compile, configure, and install a Linux
kernel running TCP BBR on Google Compute Engine.

## Prerequisites:

 * A working Google Compute Engine (GCE) account (you can sign up for a [free trial](https://cloud.google.com/free-trial/))
 * A working install of [google-cloud-sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)


### Create a Ubuntu LTS 16.04 VM

Let's start by declaring some shell variables relating to your GCE environment:

```
typeset -x PROJECT="make-tcp-fast"    # A GCE project name
typeset -x ZONE="us-west1-a"          # A GCE Zone
```

Next, we can create a VM to build the kernel with BBR. This will create a
Google Cloud instance to compile our kernel:

```
gcloud compute \
  instances create "bbrtest1" \
  --project ${PROJECT} --zone ${ZONE} \
  --machine-type "n1-standard-8" \
  --network "default" \
  --maintenance-policy "MIGRATE" \
  --boot-disk-type "pd-standard" \
  --boot-disk-device-name "bbrtest1" \
  --image "/ubuntu-os-cloud/ubuntu-1604-xenial-v20160922" \
  --boot-disk-size "20" \
  --scopes default="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly"
```
After creating the instance; log in:


```
gcloud compute ssh --project ${PROJECT} --zone ${ZONE} bbrtest1
```

Then, on your GCE instance, use apt(8) to install the packages necessary to
build a kernel (answer `Y` and press `Enter` when prompted by `apt-get`):


```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get build-dep linux
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Obtain kernel sources with TCP BBR

TCP BBR is in Linux v4.9 and beyond. However, we recommend compiling from the
latest sources, from the networking development branch. In particular, in the
`davem/net-next` networking development branch (and Linux v4.13-rc1 and
beyond) there is new support for 
[TCP-level pacing](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git/commit/?id=218af599fa635b107cfe10acf3249c4dfe5e4123).
This means that there is no longer a requirement to install the "fq" qdisc to
use BBR. Any qdisc will do.

For this guide, we'll grab the Linux networking development branch
`davem/net-next` from `git.kernel.org`.

On your GCE instance, use `git` to clone the Linux sources into
/usr/src/net-next and do the configuration and compliation as a mortal
(non-root) user:

```
# Make /usr/src writeable/sticky like /tmp:
cd /usr/src && sudo chmod 1777 .
# Clone a copy of the kernel sources:
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git
cd /usr/src/net-next
```

## Configure the kernel

If you do not yet have a Linux kernel config for GCE, you can try the
[config included in this tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/bbr/master/Documentation/config.gce).
On your GCE instance you can download that kernel config and then update that
config to select the defaults for any new config options added recently:

```
cd /usr/src/net-next
wget -O .config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/bbr/master/Documentation/config.gce
make olddefconfig
```

## Compile the kernel

Compile the kernel, on your GCE instance:

```
cd /usr/src/net-next
make prepare
make -j`nproc`
make -j`nproc` modules
```

##  Install the kernel and reboot

On your GCE instance, install the newly-compiled kernel and reboot:

```
cd /usr/src/net-next
sudo make -j`nproc` modules_install install
sudo reboot now
```

## Verify the kernel and configuration

On your GCE instance, confirm that it has booted the kernel we compiled:

```
uname -a
```

That should show something like the following, except with a version number and
build timestamp matching the kernel you compiled above:

```
Linux bbrtest1 4.8.0-rc7+ #1 SMP Thu Sep 29 20:06:31 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Finally, on your GCE instance, confirm that BBR is being used:

```
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control
```

Enjoy!

## Further reading

If you already have a kernel config for GCE, then you can just enable BBR,
rebuild, and reboot. On your GCE instance, check that if you run:

```
cd /usr/src/net-next
egrep '(_BBR)' .config
```

then you see exactly the following lines:

```
CONFIG_TCP_CONG_BBR=y
CONFIG_DEFAULT_BBR=y
```

If you want to create your own .config, then just remember to include those two
lines, and follow the
[kernel/image requirements for GCE](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/building-images).
