/* BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT) congestion control
 *
 * BBR is a model-based congestion control algorithm that aims for low queues,
 * low loss, and (bounded) Reno/CUBIC coexistence. To maintain a model of the
 * network path, it uses measurements of bandwidth and RTT, as well as (if they
 * occur) packet loss and/or shallow-threshold ECN signals. Note that although
 * it can use ECN or loss signals explicitly, it does not require either; it
 * can bound its in-flight data based on its estimate of the BDP.
 *
 * The model has both higher and lower bounds for the operating range:
 *   lo: bw_lo, inflight_lo: conservative short-term lower bound
 *   hi: bw_hi, inflight_hi: robust long-term upper bound
 * The bandwidth-probing time scale is (a) extended dynamically based on
 * estimated BDP to improve coexistence with Reno/CUBIC; (b) bounded by
 * an interactive wall-clock time-scale to be more scalable and responsive
 * than Reno and CUBIC.
 *
 * Here is a state transition diagram for BBR:
 *
 *             |
 *             V
 *    +---> STARTUP  ----+
 *    |        |         |
 *    |        V         |
 *    |      DRAIN   ----+
 *    |        |         |
 *    |        V         |
 *    +---> PROBE_BW ----+
 *    |      ^    |      |
 *    |      |    |      |
 *    |      +----+      |
 *    |                  |
 *    +---- PROBE_RTT <--+
 *
 * A BBR flow starts in STARTUP, and ramps up its sending rate quickly.
 * When it estimates the pipe is full, it enters DRAIN to drain the queue.
 * In steady state a BBR flow only uses PROBE_BW and PROBE_RTT.
 * A long-lived BBR flow spends the vast majority of its time remaining
 * (repeatedly) in PROBE_BW, fully probing and utilizing the pipe's bandwidth
 * in a fair manner, with a small, bounded queue. *If* a flow has not seen
 * a measured RTT reduction for probe_rtt_win_ms (likely meaning it has been
 * continuously sending for the entire probe_rtt_win_ms interval) then
 * it briefly enters PROBE_RTT to cut inflight to a smaller value to re-probe
 * the path's two-way propagation delay (min_rtt). When exiting PROBE_RTT, if
 * we estimated that we reached the full bw of the pipe then we enter PROBE_BW;
 * otherwise we enter STARTUP to try to fill the pipe.
 *
 * BBR is described in detail in:
 *   "BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control",
 *   Neal Cardwell, Yuchung Cheng, C. Stephen Gunn, Soheil Hassas Yeganeh,
 *   Van Jacobson. ACM Queue, Vol. 14 No. 5, September-October 2016.
 *
 * There is a public e-mail list for discussing BBR development and testing:
 *   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bbr-dev
 *
 * NOTE: BBR might be used with the fq qdisc ("man tc-fq") with pacing enabled,
 * otherwise TCP stack falls back to an internal pacing using one high
 * resolution timer per TCP socket and may use more resources.

 * performance penalty of PROBE_RTT's cwnd capping to roughly 2% (note that
 * the expected bandwidth utilization is 0.5*.2/5 + 1.0*( 5 - .2)/5 = 0.98).
