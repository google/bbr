# BBR FAQ

Here are some frequently asked questions about BBR congestion control,
including Linux TCP BBR and QUIC BBR.

## Where can I discuss BBR?

Comments, questions, and discussion are welcome on the public bbr-dev mailing
list:

  https://groups.google.com/d/forum/bbr-dev

## Where can I read about BBR?

There are Google publications about BBR linked at the top of the bbr-dev
mailing list home page:

## Where can I find the source code for Linux TCP BBR?

For Linux TCP BBR:

- The latest code:
  - https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git/tree/net/ipv4/tcp_bbr.c
- The list of commits:
  -  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git/log/net/ipv4/tcp_bbr.c

## How can I try out Linux TCP BBR?

Check out [TCP BBR Quick-Start: Building and Running TCP BBR on Google Compute Engine](https://github.com/google/bbr/blob/master/Documentation/bbr-quick-start.md).

## How can I visualize the behavior of Linux TCP BBR connections?

Check out [tcpdump](http://www.tcpdump.org/),
[tcptrace](http://www.tcptrace.org/), and
[xplot.org](http://www.xplot.org/). To install these tools on Ubuntu or Debian
you can use:

```
sudo apt-get install tcpdump tcptrace xplot-xplot.org
```

For an intro to this tool chain, see
[this slide deck](https://fasterdata.es.net/assets/Uploads/20131016-TCPDumpTracePlot.pdf).

An example session might look like:
```
# start capturing a trace:
tcpdump -w ./trace.pcap -s 120 -c 100000000 port $PORT &
# run test....
# turn trace into plot files:
tcptrace -S -zx -zy *pcap
# visualize each connection:
for f in `ls *xpl`; do echo $f ... ; xplot.org $f ; done
```

## How can I monitor Linux TCP BBR connections?

You can see output that includes BBR state variables, including pacing rate,
cwnd, bandwidth estimate, min_rtt estimate, etc., if you run:

```
ss -tin
```

If your machine does not have a recent enough version of ss to show those stats for BBR, you can download ss using the instructions here:
  https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/iproute2

Specifically, you can try something like:

```
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/iproute2/iproute2.git
cd iproute2/
./configure
make
```

Then you can run the tool as:
```
misc/ss -tin
```

And get output like the following:


```

```


## Where can I find the source code for QUIC BBR?

For QUIC BBR:

- The latest code:
  - https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/third_party/quiche/src/quic/core/congestion_control/bbr_sender.cc
  - https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/third_party/quiche/src/quic/core/congestion_control/bbr_sender.h

## How can I visualize the behavior of QUIC connections?

Check out [quic-trace](https://github.com/google/quic-trace).

## Where does the value of the BBR STARTUP pacing_gain come from?

In a nutshell, the BBR STARTUP pacing gain is derived to be the lowest gain that
will allow the pacing rate to double each round trip, when the pacing rate is
computed as a multiple of the maximum recent delivery rate seen.

Here is a detailed derivation, along with some graphs to illustrate:
